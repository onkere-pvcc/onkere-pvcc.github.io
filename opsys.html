		<td>TERM</td>
		<td>DEFINITION</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Operating system</td>
		<td>The software that controls the overall operation of the computer including file management, the user interface, and the program execution environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Job queue</td>
        <td>a list of tasks to be carried out in turn by an operating system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
		<td>FIFO</td>
        <td>First In, First Out, commonly known as FIFO, is an asset-management and valuation method in which assets produced or acquired first are sold, used, or disposed of first.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Interactive processing</td>
        <td>Interactive processing means that the person needs to provide the computer with instructions whilst it is doing the processing. For example, imagine that a computer is running a program that takes a set of files from one directory and does some work on each one.</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time-sharing</td>
        <td>time-sharing is the sharing of a computing resource among many users at the same time by means of multiprogramming and multi-tasking.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Multiprograming</td>
        <td>the running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Application software</td>
        <td>An application program (software application, or application, or app for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself,[1] typically to be used by end-users.[2] Word processors, media players, and accounting software are examples. The collective noun "application software" refers to all applications collectively.[3] The other principal classifications of software are system software, relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>System software</td>
        <td>System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications. The operating system is the best-known example of system software. The OS manages all the other programs in a computer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Utility software</td>
        <td>Utility software is software designed to help analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer.[1] It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. However, utilities often form part of the application systems. For example, a batch job may run user-written code to update a database and may then include a step that runs a utility to back up the database, or a job may run a utility to compress a disk before copying files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Graphical user interrface(GUI)</td>
        <td>The GUI (/ˌdʒiːjuːˈaɪ/ JEE-yoo-EYE[1][Note 1] or /ˈɡuːi/[2] GOO-ee), graphical user interface, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of CLIs (command-line interfaces),[3][4][5] which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shell</td>
        <td>short for shell program; which is a program which provides an interface between the user and the operating system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kernel</td>
        <td>Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of memory and CPU time. It is core component of an operating system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Device driver</td>
        <td>a device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer or automaton.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>File manager</td>
        <td>The file management in operating system is nothing but software that handles or manages the files (binary, text, pdf, docs, audio, video, etc.) present in computer software. The file system in the operating system is capable of managing individual as well as groups of files present in the computer system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Memory manager</td>
        <td>In operating systems, memory management is the function responsible for managing the computer's primary memory. The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, either allocated or free.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Virtual memory</td>
        <td>For Windows, you can manage your memory processing in the “settings” panel; type “performance” in the search bar and select “adjust appearance and processing of windows.” You then click on the “advanced” tab and under “virtual memory”, you can click on change.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Boot strapping</td>
        <td>What is bootstrap in a computer? In computing, the term bootstrap means to boot or to load a program into a computer using a much smaller initial program to load in the desired program, which is usually an OS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rom</td>
        <td>ROM (read-only memory) is a non-volatile memory type. This means it receives data and permanently writes it on a chip, and it lasts even after you turn off your computer. The data is coded to not be overwritten, so it's used for things like your printer software or your startup programs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Deadlock</td>
        <td>A deadlock is a situation in which two computer programs sharing the same resource are effectively preventing each other from accessing the resource, resulting in both programs ceasing to function. The earliest computer operating systems ran only one program at a time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Spooling</td>
        <td>To spool (which stands for "simultaneous peripheral operations online") a computer document or task list (or "job") is to read it in and store it, usually on a hard disk or larger storage medium so that it can be printed or otherwise processed at a more convenient time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Super user(or administrator)</td>
        <td>A user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Multi-factor authentication</td>
        <td>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN. MFA is a core component of a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy.</td>
