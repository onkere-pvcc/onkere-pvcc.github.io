The relationship between " ".join(song.split()) and song is:

- song.split() splits the string on whitespace into a list of words
- " ".join() joins the list back into a string with spaces between each word

In general:

- If song has no extra whitespace (like leading/trailing whitespace or multiple spaces between words), then " ".join(song.split()) will return a string identical to song.

- If song has any extra whitespace, " ".join(song.split()) will remove it by splitting on whitespace, then joining with exactly one space between words. 

So they will be the same if song has no extra whitespace. They will be different if song has any extra whitespace, in which case " ".join(song.split()) returns a 'cleaned' version with extra whitespace removed.

Some examples:

- song = "The rain in Spain..." 
   --> No extra whitespace, so they are the same

- song = "The   rain    in Spain..." 
   --> Extra whitespace, so they are different:
      " ".join(song.split()) = "The rain in Spain..."  

- song = "  The rain in Spain...  " 
   --> Leading/trailing whitespace, so they are different again
