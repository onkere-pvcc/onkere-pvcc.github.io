	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Term</th>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Debugging</td>
			<td>The process of identifying and resolving errors or bugs in a computer program or code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Assembler</td>
			<td>A program that translates assembly language code into machine language code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Assembly language</td>
			<td>A low-level programming language that is a symbolic representation of machine language code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Translator</td>
			<td>A general term for a program that converts one form of code or data into another, including assemblers, compilers, and interpreters.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Compiler</td>
			<td>A program that translates high-level programming language code into machine language code, usually resulting in an executable file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interpreter</td>
			<td>A program that directly executes high-level programming language code without first converting it into machine language code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cross-platform software</td>
			<td>Software that can run on multiple operating systems or platforms without requiring modification.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Natural language</td>
			<td>Any human language, such as English or Chinese.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Formal language</td>
			<td>A language with a precisely defined set of rules and syntax, often used in mathematics and computer science.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Machine independence</td>
			<td>The ability of a program or code to run on different types of hardware and operating systems without modification.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>High-level programming language</td>
			<td>A programming language designed to be easier to read and write than low-level languages, such as assembly language or machine language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</td>
			<td>A programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, classes, and inheritance to organize and structure code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Scripting language</td>
			<td>A type of high-level programming language that is often used for automation tasks or as a glue language to connect different programs or systems.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Integer</td>
			<td>A type of data that represents whole numbers, such as -3, 0, or 42.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Float</td>
			<td>A type of data that represents decimal numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.5.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>a type of data that represents text or characters, such as "hello" or "world".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>17.	Primitive data type</td>
            <td>a basic type of data that is built into a programming language, such as integers, floats, and strings.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data structure</td>
            <td>a way of organizing and storing data in a program, such as lists, sets, or dictionaries.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Python collection data structures</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Tuple</td>
            <td>a collection data structure in Python that represents an ordered, immutable sequence of values.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
