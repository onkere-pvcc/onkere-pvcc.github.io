3. Give the logical opposites of these conditions


(a) a > b
(b) a >= b
(c) a >= 18 and day == 3
(d) a >= 18 and day != 3

Here are the logical opposites of the given conditions:

(a) a <= b
(b) a < b
(c) a < 18 or day != 3
(d) a < 18 or day == 3

These opposites essentially reverse the comparisons and logical operations of the original conditions.f
