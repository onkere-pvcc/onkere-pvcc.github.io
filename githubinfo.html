        <ul>
            <li>Q. What is a version control system?</li>
            <li>A. Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.</li>
            <li>Q. What is Git</li>
            <li>A. Git ( / t /) is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).</li>
            <li>Q. What is GitHub?</li>
            <li>A. GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service</li>
            <li>Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? </li>
            <li>A. Git: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</li>
            <li>GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</li>
            <li>Q. Who started GitHub and how was it started</li>
            <li>A. The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.</li>
            <li>Q. What company owns it now?</li>
            <li>A. Microsoft corporation own GitHub right now</li>
            <li>Q. How much does a GitHub account cost</li>
            <li>A. the account the basic is free for individual and organisatgion, for team it's $49 per year</li>
            <li>Q. What is the octacat?</li>
            <li>A. Octocat, the mascot of the source-code hosting service GitHub. Octocat, part cat, part octopus character in Spliced (TV series) Octocat Adventure, a five-part animated video by David OReilly (artist)</li>
            <li>Git/GitHub terms:</li>
            <li>repository</li>
            <li>A repository, or repo, is computer storage for maintaining data or software packages. This location contains files, databases, or information organized for quick access over a network or directly. A repo allows consolidating data with a version control system to store metadata for every file and log changes.</li>
            <li>Commit</li>
            <li>commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to</li>
            <li>Push</li>
            <li>push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</li>
            <li>Pull requests</li>
            <li>Pull requests are a feature that makes it easier for developers to collaborate using Bitbucket. They provide a user-friendly web interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them into the official project.</li>
            <li>workflows</li>
            <li>A Workflow is defined as a sequence of tasks that processes a set of data through a specific path from initiation to completion.</li>
            <li>Issues</li>
            <li>Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request.</li>
            <li>raw button</li>
            <li>With the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling</li>
            <li>blame button</li>
            <li>With the blame view, you can view the line-by-line revision history for an entire file, or view the revision history of a single line within a file by clicking . Each time you click , you'll see the previous revision information for that line, including who committed the change and when.</li>
